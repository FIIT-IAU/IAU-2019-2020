Students will by the end of the course acquire an understanding of basic concepts and techniques of data analysis. They will understand how they work and get an intuition for their application for the purpose of knowledge acquisition from data (data mining). They will get an idea what questions can be answered with data analysis and they will be able to apply and evaluate basic machine learning approaches. The emphasis is on data analysis and preprocessing; the course material is complemented by basic methods of machine learning and methods of their evaluation and comparison.

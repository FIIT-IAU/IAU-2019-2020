# Course requirements and assessment

## Assessment during semester 

Project: **max. 50 points**
* Work on the project and tasks during labs: 5 points
* 1`. phase - exploratory analysis (week 6): 12 points
* 2`. phase - preprocessing (week 9): 18 points
* 3`. phase -  machine learning (week 12): 15 points

Project is solved in pairs.

## Late submissions
In case of not submitting a project phase on time, it is possible to submit it into AIS within 7 days after the deadline with a penalization of 50% (i.e., the assigned points for the given phase will be multiplied by a coefficient of 0.5). A submission after the hard deadline is not possible. A failure to submit a project phase before its given hard deadline will result in course failure (i.e., the student will not receive a credit for it).

## Final assessment

Points obtained during semester: max. 50 points

The final exam: **max. 50 points**

## Course requirements

1. Project preparation and presentation at an acceptable level of quality, submitted at the given deadlines
2. Active participation in labs
3. Obtaining at least 25 points during the semester
4. Obtaining at least 10 points from the final exam
5. Obtaining at least 56 points as the total of the points from the semester and the exam according to the current grading scale at FIIT STU

The course requirements also include general course requirements and assessment rules at FIIT STU. That means that the students are required to oblige with the rules of academic honesty. Any presentation of someone else’s work as the student’s own is not acceptable regardless of its extent. If a student violates these rules, it automatically means course failure (FX) and the case will be reported to the disciplinary committee at the faculty.

# Let's begin - environment setup

Welcome to the Intelligent Data Analysis course! By the end of this lab, you should:

- know [course requirements](../en/course-requirements) and how activity during semester will be assessed
- know, what you will be supposed to do as you semestral [project](../en/project) and when each phase is due
- install and setup environment needed for this course: `anaconda` (`Python` + libraries)
- run `Jupyter Notebook` and try first commnands in Python
- discuss with your teacher about the "best practices" for collaborative work in  Jupyter and how to manage code in notebooks

## Environment Setup

1. Download and install distribution `Anaconda` with the most recent Python version (version 3.7), which simplifies management of Python libraries and allows you to create separate environments with their own dependencies: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

2. In case you need it, go through these guides that will help you in more detail to insall Anaconda, setup the environment and run Python and Jupyter Notebook:

   - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
   - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/
   - https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html
   
3. Create a separate environment for the semestral project (or the entire IAU course):

```
> conda --name iau
```

4. Switch to the newly created environment:

```
> conda activate iau
```

5. Verify that you have all necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` already installed:

```
> conda list
```

6. If not, intall them. For example:

```
> conda install scikit-learn
```

7. Run Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

```
> jupyter notebook
``` 

or

```
> jupyter lab
```

8. Try to run a first Python command in Jupyter Notebook:

```
print('Hello world!')
```

## Jupyter

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is an interactive environment suitable for prototyping and presentation of analysis results. You can work with it in the older Jupter Notebook or the newer Jupyter Lab (it's entirely up to you). The only problem is that it is unfortunately not very adapted to the collaborative work or the work in teams (but it is doable with the help of git and a bit self-discipline).

Alternatively, you can work with `Colaboratory` from Google that supports collaborative work and allows you to export runnable Jupyter Notebooks: https://colab.research.google.com

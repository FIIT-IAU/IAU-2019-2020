# Basics of Python language and work with libraries for work with data

As an introduction to the Python language I recommend to go through the tutorial in the documentation [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial).

Here is a list of links to series of exercises on work with Python and libraries Numpy and Pandas.
Work on solving simple (gradually more demanding) exercises.

* Python - [https://github.com/sevo/flp_python_exercises](https://github.com/sevo/flp_python_exercises)
* Numpy - [https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100)
* Pandas - [https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles](https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles)

When solving exercises on work with libraries Numpy and Pandas use their documentation ([Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15/index.html)) or in the case of Pandas these great [tutorials ](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15/tutorials.html)

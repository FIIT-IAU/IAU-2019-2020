For this week, we selected a set of exercises on various datasets concerning data preprocessing and data reshaping. Solve tasks from this list. You can use tutorials at the end of this document as support.

# Exercises:

## Pandas repetition

Load this [dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/python-level-2/sales-funnel.csv) and write code to answer following questions.

1. Retrieve descriptive statistics about the dataset.
2. How many rows has price higher than $8,000?
3. How many rows has "pending" status and price higher than $8,000?
4. How many rows has "pending" status or price higher than $8,000?
5. Create a column named "amount" which will be filled with the product of columns "price" and "quantity". What is the sum of values in this column for rows with status "won"?
6. What is the sum total of "amount" column for rows from category "CPU"?

## Data reshaping

### Pivot table

1. Look at the examples of application of methods stack, unstack and pivot in provided tutorials.
2. What is the difference between methods "pivot" and "pivot_table"?
3. In the dataset from previous exercises, create a table where rows will contain information for various products and columns will contain information for various statuses and values will be aggregated values from column "amount". Use method sum from numpy package for aggregation.

### Groupby

1. Complete the task number 3 from Pivot table section using groupby operation.

### Cross tab

1. Create a contingency table (crosstab), which will show the number of rows with various status values and various products.
2. Create a contingency table from previous task, but replace products by values in column "Manager" or "Rep" or pairs Manager-Rep. You will thus create 3 different tables. 


## Another dataset

Write a code retrieving answers for following questions on this [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suneel0101/lesson-plan/master/crunchbase_monthly_export.csv)


1. Load the dataset. When calling read_csv function, use encoding "latin1".
2. Retrieve descriptive statistics about the dataset. What dataset are we dealing with?
3. What is maximal obtained funding? Help: you will have to transform values. Look closely on the data type in the column and on the name of the column.
4. Rename columns so they are interpretable and correctly formatted.
5. Create a table from values in column "Market" and sum of values total funding for various values in column "Market". Sort these values in decreasing order and display first 10 of them.
6. How many companies have category "Game"?
7. What is the mean total funding for companies from New York? What about companies from San Francisco? Compare these values.
